                            <p>The EG team is a tight-knit group of people with different areas of focus and different ways of communicating, but we all talk with our hands. We whiteboard, sketch, doodle, draw, mockup, diagram, and code to work collaboratively with product owners, development, and business partners and communicate ideas.</p>

                        <p>Experience designers are systems thinkers that can contribute to a design process from start to finish. This means leading discovery activities, forming insights, developing both functional and visual design, and communicating that design to the various people who make it real. Our XD’s have a range of backgrounds and never work alone. They’re process driven, work with their hands, and are excellent ambassadors for design across American Express.</p>
