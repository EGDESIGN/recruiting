We work as a team to understand user needs and design thoughtful solutions. We use sketches and our robust prototyping environment to communicate the user experience.</p>

                        <p>Experience designers are systems thinkers that can contribute to a design process from start to finish. This means leading discovery activities, forming insights, developing both functional and visual design, and communicating that design to the various people who make it real. Our XD's have a range of backgrounds and never work alone. They're process driven, work with their hands, and are excellent ambassadors for design across American Express.</p>
