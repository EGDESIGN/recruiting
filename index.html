                    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>We're designers, strategists, technologists and facilitators who are all strong design thinkers and excellent ambassadors for design across American Express.</p>
                    <p>There are four different roles on the EG Design team:</p>
                </div>

                  <div id="role-xd" class="sub-units odd">
                    <h2 class="role-abbrv xd">XD</h2>
                    <div class="sub-unit-wrap">
                        <h2>Experience Designers</h2>
                        <p>Experience Designers are systems thinkers who lead the design process from start to finish. They guide discovery research and gather insights, develop both functional and visual designers, and communicate those designs to the people who bring them to life. Our XD's are process driven, work with their hands, and come from many different backgrounds. </p>

                    <div class="sub-unit-wrap">
                        <h2>Design Managers</h2>
                        <p>Design Managers are the liaison between design and the broader business. They bridge gaps between business goals and user needs, manage communication with our partner teams, and ensure we're working efficiently. DM’s shepherd our team through the design process, and make sure our end users have a high-quality experience.</p>

                        <h2>Content Strategists</h2>
                        <p>Our Content Strategists not only shape the tone of our products, they consider where and how our content takes form. To do this, CS’s design content templates, create guidelines, write smart copy, and turn convoluted mumbo jumbo into easy to understand information. Our Content Strategists are strong writers and have a knack for creating consistency and structure. </p>

                        <h2>Experience Technologists</h2>
                        <p>Experience Technologists are front-end developers who bring our designs to life. They co-design the Serve Platform UX in the medium that it'll be experienced, and help us iterate through rapid prototyping. By designing in code, XT’s ensure that all interactions represent their original intent across every device, and that the team is working efficiently.</p>
